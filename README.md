## Predicting daily rainfall in Australia

The goal of this project is working with big data. In particular, we will build and deploy ensemble machine learning models in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia on a large dataset (~6 GB), where features are outputs of different climate models, and the target is the actual rainfall observation.
